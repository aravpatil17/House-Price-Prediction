# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to houses, such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files
- `HousePricePrediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies required for the project.
- `data/` - Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/` - Directory to save trained models.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HousePricePrediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps inside the notebook to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Modify parameters and features as needed to improve prediction accuracy.

## Model & Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or other regression models.
- Model Evaluation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing deep learning techniques for better accuracy.
- Adding more data sources to improve model generalization.
- Deploying the model as a web application.
